# TODO

## Maintenance Tasks

- Run `python3 Scripts/deduplicate.py` to deduplicate entries within each blocklist file
- Run `python3 Scripts/deduplicate_across_files.py` to check for duplicates across different files
- Run `npm run format` to format markdown, YAML, and JSON files
- Run `npm run lint:fix` to lint and auto-fix code style issues

## Future Improvements

- Consider consolidating cross-file duplicates into appropriate categories
- Add automated testing for blocklist validity
- Set up CI/CD for automatic list updates
